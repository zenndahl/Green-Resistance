# IsometricTowerDefense

Game in development by two students of Computer Science 

What is the game:
The game is a tower defense estrategy game in isometric format, where the player have turrets options to use to defend the city from alien waves.
The game consists of a start point where the enemies como from and an end point where they go to, passing through a pre-set path.

Game's Abstract:
The player will begin with an amount of money to spend on the defenses. There will be 2 maps with 3 paths each. Each map and each map path have different
options of turrets and other defenses, like buildings to passivly upgrade turrets in range, or terrain that modifies turrets attacks. Each turret have an upgrade version that can be buyed since first level. As the player progresses through the levels, different types of enemies will spawn. 

Maps:

  Power Tower (damages enemies over time, slows turrets fire rate while active)


Language and Engine:
In this project, will be used Unity Engine, therefore, the scripts will be in C# language.
Will be used the Github for Unity for version control, Aseprite for the sprites and animations.


We leave our thanks to Brackeys, an youtube chanel, that made an Tower Defense Tutorial, from where the idea for the project came and from where we learned
valueble knowladge about this type of game and the Unity Engine.
