# IsometricTowerDefense

Game in development by two students of Computer Science 

What is the game:
The game is a tower defense estrategy game in isometric format, where the player have plants, trees and fungus as turrets options to use to defend the nature from waves of humans.
The game consists of a start point where the enemies como from and an end point where they go to, passing through a pre-set path for each map.

Game's Abstract:

Each map and have different options of turrets and other defenses, like pre-planted plants to passivly upgrade turrets in range, or terrain that modifies turrets attacks (not certain feature). Some turrets have upgrades versions that can be buyed since first level. As the player progresses through the levels, different types of enemies will spawn.

Language and Engine:
In this project, will be used Unity Engine, therefore, the scripts will be in C# language.
Will be used the Github for Unity for version control, Aseprite for the sprites and animations.


We leave our thanks to Brackeys, an youtube chanel, that made an Tower Defense Tutorial, from where the idea for the project came and from where we learned
valueble knowledge about this type of game and the Unity Engine.
